# KindaVim

Most vim emulators stop at hjkl arrows. [KindaVim ↗](https://kindavim.app) — a separate macOS app by [godbout ↗](https://github.com/godbout) — gives you the *real* thing: Normal mode, Visual mode, operators, motions, and text objects across every text field on your Mac. KeyPath complements it with a live overlay, mode badge, and progress insights. The two apps coordinate; neither replaces the other.

New to keyboard customization? Read [Keyboard Concepts]({{ '/guides/concepts/' | relative_url }}) first for background on layers and dual-role keys.

## What KindaVim Adds

KindaVim is a third-party macOS app that adds genuine Vim modes to almost every text field on your Mac — Mail, Notes, Slack, your browser's address bar, code editors, and more:

- **Normal mode** — navigate, delete, yank, paste with real Vim commands
- **Visual mode** — select text with motions and text objects
- **Operators + motions** — `d3w`, `ct.`, `yap` parse exactly like Vim
- **Text objects** — `ci"`, `da(`, `vis` for inner sentence, etc.

Press `Esc` (or whatever you've configured — `fj` is a popular choice) to enter Normal mode; press `i` / `a` / `o` to return to Insert. Just like real Vim.

---

## How KeyPath Coordinates

The KindaVim **pack** in KeyPath is "visual-only" — it adds **no** keyboard remappings. KindaVim itself handles every keypress. KeyPath layers on:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| **Mode badge** | A small `VIM: NORMAL` / `INSERT` / `VISUAL` indicator in the live keyboard overlay header. |
| **hjkl arrow hints** | When KindaVim is in Normal mode, the live keyboard overlay highlights `h` / `j` / `k` / `l` with loud arrow glyphs and dims the rest. |
| **Operator-pending callout** | Press an operator (`d`, `c`, `y`) and the overlay tells you "Press `d` again for the whole line." A `5×` count badge appears while you're typing a numeric prefix. |
| **Strategy awareness** | KindaVim runs on one of two backends per app — Accessibility (full set) or Keyboard (degraded fallback for apps like Slack). KeyPath reads which is active for your frontmost app and only shows hints that will actually fire. |
| **Mastery insights** | If you opt into local-only telemetry, the Pack Detail panel shows a 30-day arrow-key reliance chart, your most-used commands with mastery tiers, and stage-appropriate suggestions ("you've never used `b` — pairs with `w` you already know"). |

## Setting It Up

### 1. Install KindaVim

Download KindaVim from [kindavim.app ↗](https://kindavim.app). KeyPath's KindaVim pack detects whether the app is installed and shows a status row in Pack Detail.

### 2. Install the KindaVim pack in KeyPath

Open the **Gallery** in KeyPath, find the **KindaVim Mode Display** pack, and turn it on. The pack:

- Adds zero kanata remappings (KindaVim handles all the keystrokes)
- Just enables KeyPath's visual layer to track and display KindaVim's state

If kindaVim.app isn't installed, KeyPath surfaces an alert with a **Get KindaVim →** button before letting you enable the pack.

### 3. (Optional) Turn on local usage stats

Pack Detail has a **Record local KindaVim usage stats** toggle. When on, KeyPath records aggregate counts (how often you press each key, time spent in each mode, etc.) and surfaces a "Your vim vocabulary" panel with charts and suggestions.

The data stays on your Mac and is never sent anywhere. A **Clear all KindaVim usage data** button in the same panel deletes it at any time.

---

## Reading the Overlay

When KindaVim is in Normal mode and the pack is on, KeyPath transforms the overlay:

- **`h` `j` `k` `l`** render as large accent-coloured arrow glyphs (◀ ▼ ▲ ▶), the loudest signal on the keyboard.
- **Other Normal-mode keys** (`w` `b` `e`, `0` `$`, `i` `a` `o`, `x`, `d` `c` `y`, `f` `t`, `gg` `G`, etc.) get small chips in the top-right corner of their keycap.
- **Tier styling** dims keys by how core they are: foundational keys at full strength, secondary keys faded, advanced (Page Up/Down, search) hidden behind a "Show all keys" toggle.
- **Operator-pending mode** dims non-motion keys to ~15% so you can see at a glance which keys will accept the next motion.

The overlay vanishes back to its normal state the instant KindaVim flips to Insert mode.

---

## Tips

- **Start with KindaVim alone** — get comfortable with Normal/Visual modes before turning on the KeyPath pack. The mode signal needs to feel intuitive before the visual layer adds value.
- **The hint layer is a teacher, not a contract** — KindaVim's two strategies (Accessibility vs. Keyboard fallback) wire up different command sets per app. KeyPath only renders hints that the *current* strategy supports.
- **Watch the arrow-reliance metric** — the headline chart in Pack Detail shows what fraction of your cursor moves are still arrow keys vs. hjkl. Down = better. A heavy vim user reaches zero.
- **Don't worry about counts in early days** — the "What to try next" panel waits until you have ~50 navigation events before suggesting anything specific.
