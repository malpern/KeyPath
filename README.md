KeyPath makes keyboard remapping on macOS simple and reliable. Built on top of the powerful [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) engine, KeyPath provides a native macOS installer and interface that handles all the complex system setup, dependency management, and debugging that typically requires command-line expertise.

## ‚ú® What is KeyPath?

KeyPath is the easiest way to remap your keyboard on macOS. Whether you want to turn Caps Lock into Escape for Vim, create custom shortcuts, or fix a broken key, KeyPath makes it simple.

### Why Use KeyPath?

- **üéØ Dead Simple**: Click to record any key, click to set what it should do. That's it.
- **‚ö° Instant Changes**: Your mappings work immediately - no restarts needed
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safe & Reliable**: Built-in safety features prevent you from getting locked out
- **üé® Native macOS App**: Looks and feels like it belongs on your Mac
- **üîß Kanata Made Easy**: Harnesses the full power of Kanata without the complexity - no manual driver installation, permission debugging, or configuration file editing required

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Download & Install

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/KeyPath/releases) or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KeyPath.git
cd KeyPath
./Scripts/build-and-sign.sh
```

### 2. Launch KeyPath

Double-click KeyPath.app to launch. The setup wizard will guide you through everything.

### 3. Create Your First Mapping

1. Click the record button next to "Input Key"
2. Press what you want to trigger the mapping:
   - **Single key** (e.g., Caps Lock)
   - **Key combo** (e.g., Cmd+Space)
   - **Key sequence** (e.g., press A, then B, then C)
3. Click the record button next to "Output Key"  
4. Press what you want it to do:
   - **Single key** (e.g., Escape)
   - **Key combo** (e.g., Cmd+C for copy)
   - **Multiple keys** (e.g., type "hello world")
5. Click Save

That's it! Your mapping is now active.

## üöÄ Powered by Kanata

KeyPath is built on top of [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata), a powerful cross-platform keyboard remapping engine. While Kanata is incredibly capable, setting it up on macOS traditionally requires significant technical expertise:

### What KeyPath's Installer Handles For You

**Complex System Dependencies:**
- Automatically installs and manages the Karabiner VirtualHID driver
- Handles code signing and notarization for all components
- Manages launchd services and daemon lifecycle
- Resolves TCC (Transparency, Consent, Control) permission issues

**Advanced Debugging & Diagnostics:**
- Built-in system state detection and conflict resolution
- Automatic log analysis and error interpretation  
- Real-time UDP communication monitoring and authentication
- Visual permission status with automated fix suggestions

**Seamless Kanata Integration:**
- Bundles a properly signed Kanata binary for macOS
- Generates Kanata configuration files automatically via AI
- Provides hot-reload capability without service restarts
- Handles complex key sequence and modifier mappings

**Normally, using Kanata on macOS requires:**
- Manual driver installation via command line
- Understanding launchd, SMJobBless, and system service management
- Debugging TCC permissions and Input Monitoring issues
- Writing complex Kanata configuration syntax by hand
- Resolving signing and notarization conflicts

**KeyPath eliminates all of this complexity** while preserving Kanata's full power and flexibility. You get enterprise-grade keyboard remapping with consumer-grade ease of use.

## üéÅ Features

- **Instant Apply** - Changes work immediately, no restart needed
- **Safety First** - Emergency stop prevents getting locked out (Ctrl+Space+Esc)
- **Smart Setup** - Wizard handles all the technical stuff for you

## üìã Common Examples

### Popular Remappings
- **Caps Lock ‚Üí Escape** - Essential for Vim users
- **Right Cmd ‚Üí Delete** - Easier reach for frequent deleters
- **F1-F12 ‚Üí Media Keys** - Volume, brightness, playback control
- **Broken Key Workaround** - Remap a broken key to a working one

### Advanced Uses
- **Hyper Key** - Turn Caps Lock into Cmd+Ctrl+Alt+Shift combo
- **App Launchers** - Map key sequences to launch favorite apps
- **Text Snippets** - Type your email address with a key combo
- **Gaming** - Create custom key combinations for complex moves
- **Workflows** - Map one key to perform multiple actions in sequence

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Security

### Emergency Stop
If your keyboard becomes unresponsive, press **Ctrl + Space + Esc** simultaneously. This immediately disables all remappings.

### Permission Requirements
KeyPath needs two permissions to work:
1. **Input Monitoring** - To detect key presses
2. **Accessibility** - To send remapped keys

The setup wizard will guide you through granting these permissions.

### What KeyPath Does NOT Do
- ‚ùå No internet connection required or used
- ‚ùå No data collection or telemetry
- ‚ùå No modification of system files
- ‚ùå No kernel extensions

## üîß Troubleshooting

### KeyPath Won't Start?
1. Make sure you have macOS 13 or later
2. Run the setup wizard again from the File menu
3. Check system logs: `tail -f /var/log/kanata.log`

### Keys Not Remapping?
1. Check the status indicator in the app
2. Make sure permissions are granted in System Settings
3. Try the "Fix Issues" button in the app
