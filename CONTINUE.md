# Continuation Notes - October 1, 2025

## What We Were Doing

Fixing kanata accessibility permission detection in the installation wizard.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. TCC Fix for Kanata Accessibility (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
- **Commit:** `7583ddc` - "fix: use TCC database for kanata accessibility permission checking"
- **Changes:**
  - Modified `PermissionOracle.swift` to always check TCC database for kanata accessibility (no Apple API exists)
  - Added path normalization for development vs installed builds
  - Input Monitoring still prefers Apple API, uses TCC as fallback only
- **Why:** Wizard was showing kanata accessibility as failed even when permission was actually granted in TCC database

### 2. Fixed Missing Types to Get Build Working
Created/updated these files to resolve build errors:
- `Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/Core/WizardStateManager.swift` - Extracted from InstallationWizardView.swift
- `Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/Core/ToastPresenting.swift` - Protocol for Core layer to present toasts
- `Sources/KeyPath/Models/KanataUIState.swift` - Extracted from KanataViewModel.swift
- Updated `WizardToastManager.swift` to conform to `ToastPresenting`
- Updated `WizardAutoFixer.swift` to use `ToastPresenting` protocol instead of concrete type
- Added missing notification names to `Notifications.swift`:
  - `.wizardClosed`
  - `.openInstallationWizard`
  - `.retryStartService`
  - `.openInputMonitoringSettings`
  - `.openAccessibilitySettings`
  - `.openApp`
- Commented out `HelpBubbleOverlay` call in `KanataManager.swift` (Core can't call UI components)

### 3. Build Status
- ‚úÖ **Production build succeeded:** `./Scripts/build-and-sign.sh` completed successfully
- ‚úÖ **Signed app created:** `dist/KeyPath.app` (9.4MB, signed on Sep 30 17:56)
- ‚ùå **Deployment blocked:** Need sudo password to copy to `/Applications/`

## Current State

**Ready to deploy and test, but needs manual deployment:**

```bash
# Manual deployment (requires password):
sudo cp -R /Volumes/FlashGordon/Dropbox/code/KeyPath/dist/KeyPath.app /Applications/

# Then launch:
open /Applications/KeyPath.app
```

## What to Test After Deployment

1. **Kanata Accessibility Detection:**
   - Open Installation Wizard
   - Check if kanata accessibility shows as ‚úÖ granted (not ‚ùå failed)
   - Verify path normalization works for both dev and installed builds

2. **Path Normalization:**
   - Check logs for: `üîÆ [Oracle] Normalized TCC path: ...`
   - Should convert dev paths (`/Volumes/.../build/KeyPath.app/...`) to installed paths (`/Applications/KeyPath.app/...`)

3. **TCC Database Query:**
   - Look for logs: `üîÆ [Oracle] Checking TCC database for kanata permissions (required for Accessibility)`
   - Should show accessibility status from TCC, Input Monitoring from Apple API

## Files Modified (Uncommitted)

```
M Sources/KeyPath/Managers/KanataManager.swift
M Sources/KeyPath/Utilities/Notifications.swift
M Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/Core/WizardAutoFixer.swift
M Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/UI/WizardToastManager.swift
A Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/Core/WizardStateManager.swift
A Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/Core/ToastPresenting.swift
A Sources/KeyPath/Models/KanataUIState.swift
```

## Next Steps

1. Commit build fixes
2. Deploy to /Applications/ (requires sudo)
3. Test kanata accessibility detection
4. Verify wizard shows correct permissions

## Notes

- The TCC fix (commit 7583ddc) is the critical change
- The other files were created to fix build errors from incomplete core/UI separation
- Build completes successfully with only deprecation warnings (safe to ignore)
