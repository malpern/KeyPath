## Prompt (v1)

```
ULTRA-WIDE LANDSCAPE BANNER, watercolor on aged cream parchment. Vintage naturalist field-notebook style.

LAYOUT: Only the middle 40% vertical strip will be visible. Everything important must sit in ONE narrow horizontal band at the exact vertical center.

SCENE: A wide horizontal band showing programming symbols ({ } [ ] < > = | ~ /) rendered as elegant calligraphic ink characters, each surrounded by a soft watercolor wash in different earth tones. The symbols are arranged in a gentle arc across the center. Between them, faint bracket pairs nest inside each other like a visual recursion.

Above the symbols, hand-lettered in elegant black ink cursive: "Symbol Layer" — positioned at the vertical center band.

BACKGROUND: Aged cream parchment edge-to-edge. NO dark edges. Coffee stains and ink splatters as decoration. All edges cream.

Style: classic naturalist watercolor, loose ink lines, pigment pooling, paper grain. Earth tones: cream, sepia, sage, teal, ochre, indigo. No people, no photos.
