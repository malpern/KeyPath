## Additional Manager-like Classes (Outside Core Managers/)

### WizardStateManager (InstallationWizard/UI/)
**Responsibilities:** Installation wizard state coordination  
**Issues:** UI-coupled, should remain separate from core managers

### VHIDDeviceManager (InstallationWizard/Core/)
**Responsibilities:** Virtual HID device management  
**Issues:** Hardware-specific, appropriate scope

## Responsibility Overlap Analysis

### Critical Overlaps

1. **Lifecycle Management**
   - KanataManager: Direct process operations
   - SimpleKanataManager: 4-state lifecycle
   - KanataLifecycleManager: 14-state lifecycle via state machine
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent behavior, multiple sources of truth

2. **Auto-start Logic**  
   - SimpleKanataManager: Simple retry with backoff
   - KanataLifecycleManager: Complex state-driven startup
   - **Impact:** Duplicate code paths, unclear precedence

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - KanataManager: TCP health checks, process monitoring
   - SimpleKanataManager: Basic health checks
   - **Impact:** Multiple monitoring systems, resource waste

4. **Error Handling**
   - KanataManager: Global error state
   - SimpleKanataManager: User-friendly error messages
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent error experience

### Clear Boundaries (Good Examples)

1. **KanataConfigManager**
   - Focused on configuration file operations
   - Clear input/output contracts
   - Minimal dependencies

2. **LaunchAgentManager**
   - System integration only
   - No business logic overlap
   - Well-defined scope

3. **ProcessLifecycleManager** 
   - Process ownership and PID management
   - Intent-based design pattern
   - Clean separation of concerns

## Threading and Resource Model

### MainActor Classes
- KanataManager (UI state)
- SimpleKanataManager (UI state)  
- KanataLifecycleManager (UI state)
- LifecycleStateMachine (state transitions)
- ProcessLifecycleManager (coordination)

### Background Processing
- KanataConfigManager (file I/O on serial queue)
- LaunchAgentManager (subprocess operations)

### Resource Ownership Conflicts
- **CGEvent Taps**: KanataManager owns multiple taps
- **File Watchers**: KanataManager owns config watchers
- **Process Monitoring**: Multiple classes check process status
- **State Publishers**: Multiple @Published properties for similar state

## Recommendations for Refactoring

### Phase 1: Address Critical Issues
1. **Split KanataManager** using extensions (Milestone 1)
2. **Extract ConfigurationService** from KanataManager (clear boundaries)
3. **Consolidate lifecycle logic** via LifecycleOrchestrator

### Phase 2: Eliminate Overlaps  
1. **Choose single lifecycle approach** (SimpleKanataManager's 4-state model recommended)
2. **Unify auto-start logic** in LifecycleOrchestrator
3. **Single health monitoring system** via centralized service

### Phase 3: Service Extraction
1. **Extract MappingEngine** from KanataManager
2. **Extract EventProcessor** from KanataManager  
3. **Extract OutputSynthesizer** from KanataManager

### Preserve as Focused Services
- KanataConfigManager ‚Üí ConfigurationService
- LaunchAgentManager (keep as-is)  
- ProcessLifecycleManager (keep as-is)
- LaunchDaemonPIDCache (absorb into ProcessLifecycleManager)

## Composition Root Location

Current manager construction appears to happen in:
- `ContentView.swift` or similar SwiftUI entry point
- App delegate or bootstrap code
- Individual manager initializers

**Recommendation:** Create centralized `CompositionRoot.swift` for dependency injection and service wiring.

## Next Steps

1. **Validate CGEvent tap usage** for EventTag compatibility
2. **Identify all @Published property dependencies** between managers  
3. **Map current initialization flow** to preserve construction order
4. **Create test coverage** for critical manager interactions before refactoring
