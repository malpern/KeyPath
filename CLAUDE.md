## Project Overview

KeyPath is a macOS application that provides keyboard remapping using Kanata as the backend engine. It features a SwiftUI frontend and a LaunchDaemon architecture for reliable system-level key remapping.

## High-Level Architecture

### System Design
```
KeyPath.app (SwiftUI) ‚Üí KanataManager ‚Üí launchctl ‚Üí Kanata daemon
                     ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
              CGEvent Capture              VirtualHID Driver
                     ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
              User Input Recording          System-wide Remapping
```

### Core Components
- **KeyPath.app**: SwiftUI application with Liquid Glass UI (macOS 15+) for recording keypaths and managing configuration
- **LaunchDaemon**: System service (`com.keypath.kanata`) that runs Kanata
- **Configuration**: User config at `~/Library/Application Support/KeyPath/keypath.kbd`
- **System Integration**: Uses CGEvent taps for key capture and launchctl for service management
- **Notifications**: UserNotificationService with actionable buttons, frontmost gating, and TTL-based deduplication

### Key Manager Classes
- `KanataManager`: **Unified manager** - handles daemon lifecycle, configuration, UI state, and user interactions
- `KeyboardCapture`: Handles CGEvent-based keyboard input recording (isolated service)
- `PermissionOracle`: **üîÆ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE** - Single source of truth for all permission detection
- `UserNotificationService`: macOS Notification Center integration with categories, actions, and intelligent gating
- `InstallationWizard/`: Multi-step setup flow with auto-fix capabilities
  - `SystemStatusChecker`: System state detection (MUST trust Oracle without overrides)
  - `WizardNavigationEngine`: State-driven wizard navigation logic
  - `WizardAutoFixer`: Automated issue resolution
- `ProcessLifecycleManager`: Manages Kanata process state and recovery
- `PermissionService`: Legacy TCC database utilities (Oracle handles logic)

### UI Architecture
- **AppGlass**: Abstraction for Liquid Glass visual effects (macOS 15+)
  - `headerStrong`: Bold glass effect for major headers
  - `cardBold`: Glass effect for card containers
  - Falls back to NSVisualEffectView materials on older macOS versions
  - Honors system "Reduce Transparency" accessibility setting
- **Design System**: Centralized color tokens and spacing in `WizardDesignSystem`
- **Window Management**: Custom titlebar accessories and draggable area views (experimental)

### üîÆ PermissionOracle Architecture (CRITICAL - DO NOT BREAK)

**THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE: Apple APIs ALWAYS take precedence over TCC database**

The PermissionOracle follows a strict hierarchy that was broken in commit 7f68821 and restored:

```
1. APPLE APIs (IOHIDCheckAccess from GUI context) ‚Üí AUTHORITATIVE
   ‚îú‚îÄ .granted/.denied ‚Üí TRUST THIS RESULT (never bypass with TCC)
   ‚îî‚îÄ .unknown ‚Üí Proceed to TCC fallback

2. TCC DATABASE ‚Üí NECESSARY FALLBACK for .unknown cases
   ‚îú‚îÄ REQUIRED to break chicken-and-egg problems in wizard scenarios
   ‚îú‚îÄ When service isn't running, can't do functional verification  
   ‚îú‚îÄ When wizard needs permissions before starting service
   ‚îî‚îÄ Can be stale/inconsistent (why it's not primary source)

3. FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION ‚Üí For accessibility status only
   ‚îî‚îÄ UDP connectivity test (cannot determine Input Monitoring)
```

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS (what commit 7f68821 broke):**
- Bypass Apple API results with TCC database queries
- Use TCC database when Apple API returns definitive answers
- Assume TCC database is more current than Apple APIs

**‚úÖ CORRECT BEHAVIOR (restored here):**
- Trust Apple API `.granted/.denied` results unconditionally  
- DO use TCC database when Apple API returns `.unknown` (necessary for wizard scenarios)
- TCC fallback is REQUIRED to break chicken-and-egg problems
- Log source clearly: "gui-check" vs "tcc-fallback"

**Historical Context:**
- **commit 71d7d06**: Original correct Oracle design
- **commit 7f68821**: ‚ùå Broke Oracle by always using TCC fallback  
- **commit 8445b36**: ‚úÖ Restored Oracle Apple-first hierarchy
- **commit bbdd053**: ‚úÖ Fixed UI consistency by removing SystemStatusChecker overrides

### üö® UI Consistency (CRITICAL LESSON - September 1, 2025)

**Problem:** Different UI components showed conflicting permission status.
- Main screen: ‚úÖ Green checkmark
- Wizard screens: ‚ùå Red X marks

**Root Cause:** SystemStatusChecker contained Oracle overrides that were never removed after fixing the Oracle.

**Architecture Rule:** ALL UI components must use Oracle as single source of truth.

```swift
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - All components use same Oracle API
let snapshot = await PermissionOracle.shared.currentSnapshot()
if snapshot.keyPath.inputMonitoring.isReady { /* show green */ }

// ‚ùå WRONG - Different components use different permission checks
// MainScreen: Oracle ‚Üí Green ‚úÖ
// Wizard: SystemStatusChecker overrides Oracle ‚Üí Red ‚ùå
```

**Components That Must Use Oracle Consistently:**
- `StartupValidator` (main screen status) ‚Üí Uses Oracle ‚úÖ
- `SystemStatusChecker` (wizard status) ‚Üí MUST trust Oracle without overrides ‚úÖ
- `ContentView` status indicators ‚Üí Uses Oracle ‚úÖ
- All permission UI components ‚Üí Must use Oracle ‚úÖ

**Never Add These SystemStatusChecker Overrides Again:**
- "TCC Domain Mismatch" logic that assumes system/user database differences
- "HARD EVIDENCE OVERRIDE" that parses kanata logs for permission errors
- Any logic that modifies Oracle results based on assumptions

**The Fix:** SystemStatusChecker now trusts Oracle unconditionally (commit bbdd053).

### üéØ SystemStatusChecker Simplification (September 1, 2025)

**Problem:** Cache staleness was causing UI inconsistency even after waiting for service ready.
- StartupValidator properly waits for kanata service to be ready
- But SystemStatusChecker returns cached results from BEFORE service was ready
- Wizard invalidates cache and sees fresh (correct) results
- Main screen shows stale errors, wizard shows green

**Root Cause:** SystemStatusChecker had a 2-second cache that was designed to prevent validation spam.
- Cache was originally added to handle rapid repeated validation calls
- But we already solved that by removing the Oracle update listener
- Validation now only runs on: app launch, wizard close, config updates, manual refresh
- These are infrequent enough that caching causes more problems than it solves

**The Solution:** Removed cache entirely from SystemStatusChecker.
- No more cache properties, timestamps, or TTL logic
- Every `detectCurrentState()` call runs fresh detection
- Eliminates entire class of timing bugs and staleness issues
- Keeps solution simple and maintainable
- Minimal performance impact since validation is infrequent

**Architectural Principle:** When you fix the root cause (validation spam), remove the workaround (cache).

### üéØ Validation Spam Fix (September 1, 2025 - Final)

**Problem:** Even after removing cache, validation spam continued due to automatic listeners.
- StartupValidator listened to `kanataManager.$isRunning` publisher
- StartupValidator listened to `kanataManager.$lastConfigUpdate` publisher
- These fired during app launch, triggering multiple validations that cancelled each other
- First validation would start ‚Üí second validation cancels it ‚Üí third validation completes
- User saw brief error/spinner state from cancelled validations

**Root Cause:** Automatic revalidation on system state changes.
- Originally added to keep UI fresh when system changes
- But caused same validation spam problem as Oracle listener
- Multiple validations firing within milliseconds cancelled each other
- Each new validation reset `validationState = .checking` before running
- Cancelled validations left UI in `.checking` state

**The Solution:** Removed ALL automatic revalidation listeners.
- Removed `kanataManager.$isRunning` listener
- Removed `kanataManager.$lastConfigUpdate` listener
- Removed `PermissionOracle` update listener (already done earlier)
- Validation now ONLY runs when explicitly triggered:
  1. App launch (after service ready)
  2. Wizard close (with force: true to bypass throttle)
  3. Manual refresh

**Result:** Single validation runs on app launch, completes cleanly, shows correct status immediately.

**Final Issue:** Oracle cache invalidation in SystemStatusChecker caused interference.
- SystemStatusChecker.detectCurrentState() always invalidated Oracle cache (line 116)
- When wizard auto-opened at app launch, it invalidated cache during StartupValidator's check
- This caused CancellationError in shared UDP client
- StartupValidator saw "UDP Server Not Responding" and showed error

**Final Fix:** Removed Oracle cache invalidation from SystemStatusChecker.
- Oracle already has its own 5-second cache management
- Concurrent validations (StartupValidator + SystemStatusChecker) no longer interfere
- Each validation gets consistent Oracle data without cancellation

**Key Architectural Lesson:** Shared resources (Oracle, UDP client) must not be invalidated by one caller while another is using them. Let each resource manage its own lifecycle.

**Persistent Issue:** ContentView still had onChange listeners triggering validation.
- Even after removing Combine listeners in StartupValidator
- ContentView had SwiftUI `.onChange(of: kanataManager.lastConfigUpdate)` and `.onChange(of: kanataManager.currentState)`
- These fired during app launch when KanataManager updated state
- Triggered refreshValidation() which cancelled StartupValidator's initial validation
- Multiple validations ran and cancelled each other

**Final Fix:** Removed onChange validation triggers from ContentView.
- Kept status message for config updates
- Removed `startupValidator.refreshValidation()` calls
- Validation now ONLY triggered by: app launch, wizard close, manual refresh button
- No more automatic revalidation on state changes anywhere in the codebase

**Still Persistent (Restart Issue):** Multiple notification handlers causing duplicate validations.
- ContentView had 4 different handlers that could trigger validation:
  1. Wizard sheet `onDismiss` ‚Üí removed
  2. NotificationCenter `.wizardClosed` ‚Üí removed
  3. NotificationCenter `.kp_startupValidate` ‚Üí removed (consolidated)
  4. NotificationCenter `.kp_startupRevalidate` ‚Üí kept as single source
- StartupCoordinator posted BOTH `.kp_startupValidate` AND `.kp_startupRevalidate` ‚Üí fixed to post only `.kp_startupRevalidate`
- When wizard closed, 3 handlers fired simultaneously causing 3 concurrent validations
- Logs showed 3 validations starting within 2 seconds, all cancelling each other

**Ultimate Fix:** Consolidated to single validation trigger.
- All validation now triggered via `.kp_startupRevalidate` notification only
- StartupCoordinator: posts `.kp_startupRevalidate` at T+1.0s (removed duplicate at T+1.5s)
- Wizard close: posts `.kp_startupRevalidate` (removed sheet onDismiss and `.wizardClosed` handlers)
- Result: ONE validation runs per trigger event, no more cancellations

**Architectural Lesson:** When using notifications, have ONE publisher and ONE subscriber per event. Multiple handlers for the same logical event cause duplicate processing and race conditions.

### Notification System
The `UserNotificationService` provides intelligent user notifications with:
- **Categories**: Service failure, recovery, permission issues, informational
- **Actionable Buttons**: Open Wizard, Start Service, Open Input Monitoring/Accessibility settings, Open App
- **Smart Gating**: Only shows notifications when app is not frontmost (avoids duplicate alerts)
- **Deduplication**: Per-key TTL prevents notification spam (persisted in UserDefaults)
- **Delegate Actions**: Notification actions trigger appropriate app behaviors (retry start, open settings, etc.)
- **Integration Points**: StartupValidator (permissions), ContentView (emergency stop), KanataManager (service failures)

### Installation Wizard Flow
The wizard follows a state-driven architecture with these key pages:
1. **Summary** - Overview of system state
2. **Conflicts** - Detect/resolve Karabiner conflicts
3. **Permissions** - Input monitoring & accessibility
4. **Components** - Kanata & Karabiner driver installation
5. **Service** - Start the Kanata daemon

### Testing Notes

Integration tests may require administrator privileges for:
- Managing launchctl services
- Creating/modifying system files
- Running kanata with required permissions

For frequent testing, you may want to set up passwordless sudo locally (not recommended for production environments).

**Alternative with expect (if you have a password):**
```bash
# Using expect script for password automation
./Scripts/run-with-password.exp "your-password" sudo /usr/bin/pkill -f kanata
```

## Installation & Deployment

### Install to /Applications
```bash
# Build and copy to Applications
./Scripts/build.sh
cp -r build/KeyPath.app /Applications/

# Or for signed/notarized build
./Scripts/build-and-sign.sh
cp -r dist/KeyPath.app /Applications/
```

### System Service Installation
```bash
# Note: install-system.sh doesn't exist - service is managed by the app
# The app handles LaunchDaemon installation via InstallationWizard

# Uninstall everything
sudo ./Scripts/uninstall.sh
```

## Service Management

### launchctl Commands
```bash
# Start/restart service
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.keypath.kanata

# Stop service  
sudo launchctl kill TERM system/com.keypath.kanata

# Check status
sudo launchctl print system/com.keypath.kanata

# View logs
tail -f /var/log/kanata.log

# Check if UDP server is running (if enabled)
netstat -an | grep 37000  # or your chosen port
```

### Configuration
- User config: `~/Library/Application Support/KeyPath/keypath.kbd`
- Hot reload: Configuration reloaded via UDP without service restart
- UDP server: Configured automatically by KeyPath with secure authentication

## Dependencies

- **Kanata**: Keyboard remapping engine (bundled with app)
- **Location**: `/Applications/KeyPath.app/Contents/Library/KeyPath/kanata` (bundled)
- **macOS 14.0+**
- **Permissions**: Accessibility (app) + Input Monitoring (kanata binary)
- **Communication**: UDP server with secure authentication

## Kanata Config Format

```lisp
(defcfg
  process-unmapped-keys yes
)

(defsrc caps)
(deflayer base esc)
```

### UDP Server Configuration

Kanata supports a UDP server for secure communication with KeyPath. The UDP server enables:
- Authentication-based session management
- Configuration validation and hot-reload
- Secure command execution with token-based auth

**Enable UDP Server:**
```bash
# Start kanata with UDP server (configured automatically by KeyPath)
/usr/local/bin/kanata --cfg /path/to/config.kbd --port 37000

# UDP server listens on localhost only by default for security
# Authentication required for all operations except initial handshake
```

**UDP Server Features:**
- **Secure Authentication**: Token-based authentication with session expiry
- **Session Management**: Sessions cached in Keychain with expiration tracking
- **Config Validation**: Live validation of keyboard configuration files
- **Hot Reload**: Configuration changes applied without service restart
- **Size Limits**: UDP packets limited to 1200 bytes for reliability

**Security Features:**
- All operations require valid authentication token
- Sessions expire automatically for security
- Localhost-only binding prevents external access
- Token storage via macOS Keychain for security

**IMPORTANT: UDP Configuration Method**
- UDP server is configured via **command line arguments only** (`--port <port>`)
- **NOT** configured in the `.kbd` config file
- The `.kbd` file only contains keyboard mappings, layers, and key definitions
- KeyPath manages UDP preferences and authentication automatically
- No manual token management required - handled by KeyPath

## Key Mapping

KanataManager handles special key conversions:
- `caps` ‚Üí Caps Lock
- `space` ‚Üí Space  
- `tab` ‚Üí Tab
- `escape` ‚Üí Escape
- `return` ‚Üí Return
- `delete` ‚Üí Backspace
- Multi-char outputs ‚Üí Macro sequences

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Implement changes following existing patterns
3. Run tests: `swift test`
4. Build and test app: `./Scripts/build.sh`
5. Create PR with description

### Debugging Issues
1. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/kanata.log`
2. Verify permissions: System Settings > Privacy & Security
3. Check service status: `sudo launchctl print system/com.keypath.kanata`
4. Run diagnostics: Use DiagnosticsView in the app

### Working with the Wizard
- State detection is in `SystemStateDetector.swift`
- Auto-fix logic is in `WizardAutoFixer.swift`
- UI pages are in `InstallationWizard/UI/Pages/`
- All types are consolidated in `WizardTypes.swift`

## Troubleshooting

- **Service won't start**: Check kanata path with `which kanata`
- **Config invalid**: Test with `kanata --cfg "~/Library/Application Support/KeyPath/keypath.kbd" --check`
- **Permissions**: Grant in System Settings > Privacy & Security
- **Logs**: Check `/var/log/kanata.log`
- **Emergency stop**: Ctrl+Space+Esc disables all remapping

## Code Signing

Production builds require:
- Developer ID signing
- Runtime hardening
- Notarization via `build-and-sign.sh`

## Deployment Instructions

**CRITICAL: TCC-Safe Deployment Process**

For ALL deployments, use this TCC-safe process to preserve Input Monitoring permissions:

```bash
# Recommended deployment process:
./Scripts/build-and-sign.sh && cp -r dist/KeyPath.app /Applications/
```

**NEVER:**
- Use `build.sh` for production (lacks notarization)
- Move app to different locations during updates
- Use unsigned builds  
- Change bundle identifier or signing certificate

**Why This Matters:**
- Preserves stable TCC identity (Team ID + Bundle ID + Path)
- Users won't need to re-grant Input Monitoring permissions
- In-place replacement maintains TCC database entries

**Pre-Deployment Steps:**
1. Format code with Swift formatter (if SwiftFormat is available)
2. Fix linting issues with SwiftLint (if available): `swiftlint --fix --quiet`
3. **SKIP TESTS** unless explicitly requested (e.g., "run tests", "test before deploying")

This speeds up deployment by avoiding the test suite which can be time-consuming.

## Code Quality Commands

```bash
# Format Swift code (if SwiftFormat installed)
swiftformat Sources/ Tests/ --swiftversion 5.9

# Lint and auto-fix (if SwiftLint installed)
swiftlint --fix --quiet

# Check for issues without fixing
swiftlint
```

## Safety Features

1. **Emergency Stop**: Ctrl+Space+Esc immediately disables all remapping
2. **Config Validation**: All configs are validated before application
3. **Atomic Updates**: Configuration changes are atomic
4. **Timeout Protection**: 30-second startup timeout prevents hangs
5. **Process Recovery**: Automatic restart on crash via launchctl

## Testing Philosophy

- **Integration over unit tests** for system interactions
- **Test against real system** - minimize mocks
- **Fast feedback** through focused test scopes
- Tests are in `Tests/KeyPathTests/` and integration tests use real system calls
