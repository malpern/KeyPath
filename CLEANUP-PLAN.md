---

## Executive Summary

The KeyPath codebase is generally well-structured, but contains:
- **852 lines of completely dead code** (never called, never referenced)
- **Over-engineered abstractions** with no concrete implementations
- **Large files** (2,794 lines) that violate Single Responsibility Principle
- **Confusing deprecation markers** on actively-used code

This plan prioritizes **safe deletions first** (Phase 1-2), then **structural improvements** (Phase 3-4).

---

## Phase 1: Critical Dead Code Removal âœ… COMPLETE

**Executed:** October 24, 2025
**Commit:** 1c29843
**Lines Removed:** -694 lines

### Task 1.1: Delete Event Processing Framework âœ…
**Files to Delete:**
- `Sources/KeyPath/Core/Events/EventProcessingSetup.swift` (53 lines) - 100% dead
- `Sources/KeyPath/Core/Events/EventRouter.swift` (216 lines) - unused framework
- Partial: `Sources/KeyPath/Core/Events/DefaultEventProcessor.swift` - remove auto-registration code

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search for all references to `EventProcessingSetup`:
   ```bash
   rg "EventProcessingSetup" Sources/ Tests/
   ```
   Expected: Zero results (currently only self-references)

2. Search for `defaultEventRouter`:
   ```bash
   rg "defaultEventRouter" Sources/ Tests/
   ```
   Expected: Only in files being deleted

3. Verify `KeyboardCapture` doesn't use `EventRouter`:
   ```bash
   rg "EventRouter" Sources/KeyPath/Services/KeyboardCapture.swift
   ```
   Expected: Zero results or only import (can be removed)

4. Build and test:
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift test --filter KeyboardCaptureTests
   ```

**Why Safe to Delete:**
- `setupDefaultProcessors()` never called anywhere
- `setupDebuggingProcessors()` never called anywhere
- `defaultEventRouter` only referenced within its own module
- KeyboardCapture handles events directly without this router

**Impact:** -427 lines, removes confusing framework pattern

---

### Task 1.2: Delete Duplicate Sound Class âœ…
**File to Delete:**
- `Sources/KeyPath/Utilities/SoundPlayer.swift` (59 lines)

**Keep:**
- `Sources/KeyPath/Utilities/SoundManager.swift` (actively used, 13 calls in KanataManager)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm SoundPlayer has zero references:
   ```bash
   rg "SoundPlayer" Sources/ Tests/
   ```
   Expected: Zero results outside the file itself

2. Confirm SoundManager has all needed methods:
   ```bash
   rg "SoundManager\\.shared\\." Sources/
   ```
   Expected: Multiple calls to playTinkSound, playGlassSound, playErrorSound

3. Build and test sounds:
   ```bash
   swift build
   # Manual test: Trigger success/error in UI to verify sounds still play
   ```

**Why Safe to Delete:**
- SoundPlayer has zero external references
- SoundManager provides identical functionality
- No test coverage for SoundPlayer (proves it's unused)

**Impact:** -59 lines, clarifies audio API

---

### Task 1.3: Delete Dead Wizard State Machine âœ…
**File to Delete:**
- `Sources/KeyPath/InstallationWizard/Core/WizardStateMachine.swift` (366 lines)

**Keep (actively used):**
- `WizardStateManager.swift`
- `WizardNavigationEngine.swift`
- `WizardNavigationCoordinator.swift`
- `WizardStateInterpreter.swift`

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm WizardStateMachine is never instantiated:
   ```bash
   rg "WizardStateMachine\\(" Sources/ Tests/
   ```
   Expected: Zero instantiations

2. Verify the four classes it claims to replace ARE still used:
   ```bash
   rg "WizardStateManager\\(\\)" Sources/KeyPath/UI/InstallationWizardView.swift
   rg "WizardNavigationCoordinator\\(\\)" Sources/KeyPath/UI/InstallationWizardView.swift
   ```
   Expected: Active instantiations in InstallationWizardView

3. Build and test wizard:
   ```bash
   swift build
   # Manual test: Open wizard and verify navigation works
   ```

**Why Safe to Delete:**
- File comment claims it "replaces" four classes, but those are still actively used
- Zero instantiations or references to WizardStateMachine
- This appears to be a failed refactoring attempt that was never completed

**Impact:** -366 lines, removes architectural confusion

---

## Phase 2: Code Quality Cleanup âœ… COMPLETE

**Executed:** October 24, 2025
**Commit:** TBD
**Lines Removed:** -9 lines (vs. planned -204)

### Task 2.1: Evaluate ConfigurationProviding Protocol âœ…
**File to Audit:**
- `Sources/KeyPath/Core/Contracts/ConfigurationProviding.swift` (154 lines)

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF no concrete implementations found:
    â†’ DELETE the file (unused abstraction)
ELSE IF 1 implementation found:
    â†’ DELETE protocol, use concrete class directly
ELSE IF 2+ implementations found:
    â†’ KEEP protocol (legitimate abstraction)
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search for any class conforming to ConfigurationProviding:
   ```bash
   rg "ConfigurationProviding" Sources/ --type swift | grep -E "class|struct|enum"
   ```
   Expected: Zero conformances (only protocol definition)

2. Search for any usage of the protocol type:
   ```bash
   rg ": ConfigurationProviding" Sources/
   rg "<.*ConfigurationProviding.*>" Sources/
   ```
   Expected: Zero type annotations using this protocol

3. If zero implementations â†’ DELETE
4. Build verification:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```

**Decision:** KEEP protocol (actively used)

**Reasoning:**
- Found legitimate implementation: `ConfigurationService: FileConfigurationProviding`
- Protocol hierarchy is clean: `ConfigurationProviding` â†’ `FileConfigurationProviding` â†’ `ConfigurationService`
- Not over-engineered, properly abstracts configuration loading

**Impact:** Validated architecture is correct, not bloated

---

### Task 2.2: Clean Up Deprecation Markers âœ…
**Files with `@available(*, deprecated)`:**
- `Sources/KeyPath/Managers/KanataManager.swift` (KeyMapping struct, line 14)
- `Sources/KeyPath/Services/RecordingCoordinator.swift`
- `Sources/KeyPath/Services/ProcessLifecycleManager.swift`

**For Each Deprecated Item:**
1. Search for actual usage:
   ```bash
   rg "KeyMapping" Sources/ Tests/ | grep -v "deprecated" | head -20
   ```

2. Decision:
   - **If actively used:** Remove `@available(*, deprecated)` marker
   - **If unused:** Delete the entire type/method

3. Verify build:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```

**Example - KeyMapping struct:**
```swift
// Current (line 14-47 in KanataManager.swift):
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Use KeyPathError.configuration(...) instead")
public struct KeyMapping: Codable, Equatable, Identifiable, Sendable {
    public let id: UUID
    public let input: String
    public let output: String
}
```

**Check usage:**
```bash
rg "KeyMapping\\(" Sources/ --type swift
```

**Result:** Removed all 3 deprecation markers (9 lines total)

**Locations:**
- KanataManager.swift:14-18 (KeyMapping - 50 active uses)
- RecordingCoordinator.swift:530-531 (RecordingFailureReason - actively used)
- ProcessLifecycleManager.swift:10-11 (ProcessIntent - actively used)

**Impact:** Removed confusing deprecation warnings on actively-used code

---

### Task 2.3: Review TODO Comments âœ…
**Known TODO Locations:**
- Line ~1500: `// TODO: Post notification for UI layer to show help bubble`
- Line ~800: `// TODO: Re-enable driver installation guide when DriverInstallationGuideView is available`
- Line ~1300: `// TODO: Surface this as a wizard issue with severity .critical`

**For Each TODO:**
1. Locate exact line:
   ```bash
   rg "TODO:" Sources/KeyPath/ -n
   ```

2. Decision:
   - **If planned feature:** Keep TODO, add issue number reference
   - **If obsolete:** Delete comment and surrounding dead code
   - **If quick fix:** Implement immediately

**Result:** All 4 TODO comments reviewed and kept

**Locations:**
1. WizardAutoFixer.swift:247 - Re-enable driver installation guide (future feature)
2. WizardAsyncOperationManager.swift:200 - Move code to UI layer (architectural improvement)
3. LaunchDaemonInstaller.swift:2289 - Surface as wizard issue (error handling)
4. KanataManager.swift:1806 - Post notification for UI (future feature)

**Decision:** All TODOs are legitimate future work, kept as-is

**Impact:** Validated all TODOs are actionable and properly documented

---

## Phase 3: Reduce File Sizes (16-24 hours)

### Task 3.1: Extract from KanataManager (Priority)
**Current:** 2,794 lines (3.5x over 800-line limit)

**Target:** ~800 lines focused on orchestration only

**Extraction Strategy:**

#### Step 1: Move Configuration Logic
**Current location:** KanataManager.swift lines 1200-1800
**Destination:** `Sources/KeyPath/Managers/KanataConfigManager.swift` (already exists, 513 lines)

**Methods to move:**
- All config file I/O operations
- Config validation beyond basic checks
- Config backup/restore logic
- Template management

**Verification:**
```bash
# After extraction
wc -l Sources/KeyPath/Managers/KanataManager.swift
# Expected: ~2200 lines (600 line reduction)

swift build
swift test --filter KanataManagerTests
```

#### Step 2: Move Lifecycle Management
**Current location:** Mixed throughout KanataManager
**Destination:** `Sources/KeyPath/Services/ProcessLifecycleManager.swift` (already exists)

**Methods to move:**
- Process start/stop/restart logic (not orchestration)
- State transition validation
- Crash recovery mechanisms

**Verification:**
```bash
wc -l Sources/KeyPath/Managers/KanataManager.swift
# Expected: ~1600 lines (600 more line reduction)

swift build
swift test
```

#### Step 3: Move Diagnostics
**Current location:** KanataManager lines 2200-2794
**Destination:** `Sources/KeyPath/Services/DiagnosticsService.swift` (already exists, 537 lines)

**Methods to move:**
- Detailed diagnostic collection
- Log parsing and analysis
- System health checks

**Final verification:**
```bash
wc -l Sources/KeyPath/Managers/KanataManager.swift
# Target: ~800 lines

swift build
swift test
```

**What Remains in KanataManager:**
- Service orchestration and coordination
- High-level public API
- Property delegation to services
- Simple state calculations

**Impact:** Improves maintainability, reduces cognitive load, enables parallel development

---

### Task 3.2: Extract from ContentView (Lower Priority)
**Current:** 1,160 lines
**Target:** ~600 lines

**Extraction Strategy:**

#### Create Dedicated ViewModels:
1. **RecordingViewModel** - Extract lines 50-300 (recording UI logic)
2. **WizardCoordinationViewModel** - Extract lines 600-1000 (wizard orchestration)
3. **ErrorHandlingViewModel** - Extract lines 1000-1160 (error dialogs)

**Note:** This is lower priority than KanataManager refactoring

**Impact:** Easier testing, simpler modifications

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Clarity (4-8 hours)

### Task 4.1: Document PermissionService's Evolved Role
**File:** `Sources/KeyPath/Services/PermissionService.swift`

**Current state:** Has comment about being "slimmed down" but no architectural docs

**Add to CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
### PermissionService Architecture Evolution

**Historical:** PermissionService originally handled all permission checks directly

**Current (Post-Oracle):**
- PermissionService is now a TCC database reader ONLY
- All permission logic moved to PermissionOracle
- Service provides safe, deterministic database queries as Oracle fallback
- DO NOT add permission logic here - use Oracle

**Related:** See ADR-001 (Oracle Pattern), ADR-006 (Apple API Priority)
```

**Impact:** Prevents future confusion about permission architecture

---

### Task 4.2: Evaluate KeyboardCaptureAdapter
**File:** `Sources/KeyPath/UI/RecordingCoordinator.swift` (lines 1-20)

**Current:**
```swift
final class KeyboardCaptureAdapter: RecordingCapture {
    private let capture: KeyboardCapture
    // Just forwards all calls...
}
```

**Question:** Is this adapter actually needed, or can we use KeyboardCapture directly?

**Verification:**
1. Check why adapter exists (git history):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -S "KeyboardCaptureAdapter" Sources/KeyPath/UI/RecordingCoordinator.swift
   ```

2. Check if RecordingCapture protocol has multiple implementations:
   ```bash
   rg "RecordingCapture" Sources/ | grep -E "class|struct"
   ```

3. **If only 1 implementation:** Delete adapter, use KeyboardCapture directly
4. **If 2+ implementations:** Keep adapter (legitimate abstraction)

**Impact:** -30 lines if removed, simpler code

---

## Testing Strategy

### High-Risk Changes (Require Full Test Suite)
- Event processing removal â†’ Test keyboard recording
- Configuration protocol removal â†’ Test config load/save
- KanataManager extraction â†’ Full integration tests

**Test Commands:**
```bash
swift test
./run-tests.sh  # Full test suite including manual tests
```

### Low-Risk Changes (Build Verification Only)
- Deleting WizardStateMachine (not instantiated)
- Deleting SoundPlayer (not referenced)
- Documentation updates

**Quick Verification:**
```bash
swift build
# Manual smoke test in UI
```
