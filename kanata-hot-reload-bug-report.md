# Kanata Hot Reload Bug Report

## Summary
Hot reload mechanism gets stuck in "reload already pending" state and never completes, preventing configuration changes from being applied.

## Environment
- **Kanata Version**: v1.9.0
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- **Architecture**: arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Installation**: Homebrew (`/usr/local/bin/kanata`)
- **Launch Method**: LaunchDaemon via launchctl

## Bug Description

### Expected Behavior
When a configuration file is modified while using `--watch`, Kanata should:
1. Detect the file change via file watcher
2. Trigger reload process
3. Complete reload and apply new configuration
4. Continue processing with updated mappings

### Actual Behavior  
1. ✅ File watcher detects change correctly
2. ✅ Reload process is triggered
3. ❌ **Reload gets stuck in pending state**
4. ❌ **New configuration never applied**
5. ❌ **All subsequent reload attempts show "reload already pending"**

## Reproduction Steps

1. Start Kanata with watch mode:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/kanata --cfg /path/to/config.kbd --watch --debug --log-layer-changes
   ```

2. Create initial config file:
   ```lisp
   (defcfg
     process-unmapped-keys no
   )
   
   (defsrc
     caps
   )
   
   (deflayer base
     esc
   )
   ```

3. Modify config file to add new mapping:
   ```lisp
   (defcfg
     process-unmapped-keys no
   )
   
   (defsrc
     caps 1
   )
   
   (deflayer base
     esc 2
   )
   ```

4. Check logs and test functionality

## Log Evidence

### File Detection (Works Correctly)
```
12:06:22.1339 [DEBUG] kanata_state_machine::file_watcher: File watcher event received: Any for path: /path/to/config.kbd
12:06:22.1340 [INFO] Config file changed: /path/to/config.kbd (event: Any), triggering reload
```

### Stuck State (Bug Manifestation)  
```
12:06:22.1340 [DEBUG] kanata_state_machine::kanata: reload already pending; not resetting fallback timer
```

### Subsequent Attempts (All Fail)
Every subsequent file change produces the same result:
```
12:10:17.5851 [INFO] Config file changed: /path/to/config.kbd (event: Any), triggering reload
12:10:17.5851 [DEBUG] kanata_state_machine::kanata: reload already pending; not resetting fallback timer
```

## Impact

### Severity: High
- **User Experience**: Hot reload feature is completely non-functional
- **Workaround Required**: Manual service restart needed for every config change
- **Development Impact**: Significantly slows down configuration iteration

### Affected Features
- `--watch` flag functionality
- Hot reload mechanism
- Configuration file monitoring

## Investigation Results

### What Works
- ✅ File watcher detects changes instantly (< 0.1ms)
- ✅ Reload trigger mechanism activates correctly
- ✅ Configuration syntax validation passes
- ✅ Manual config validation: `kanata --cfg config.kbd --check` succeeds

### What's Broken
- ❌ Reload completion process
- ❌ "Fallback timer" mechanism  
- ❌ Configuration application after reload trigger
- ❌ Clearing of "pending" state

## Debugging Information

### Process Status
```bash
$ launchctl print system/com.keypath.kanata
system/com.keypath.kanata = {
    active count = 1
    state = running
    program = /usr/local/bin/kanata
}
```

### Config Validation
```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/kanata --cfg /path/to/config.kbd --check
[INFO] kanata v1.9.0 starting
[INFO] validating config only and exiting
[INFO] process unmapped keys: false
[INFO] config file is valid
```

### Service Arguments
```bash
/usr/local/bin/kanata --cfg /path/to/config.kbd --port 54141 --watch --debug --log-layer-changes
```

## Potential Root Cause

Based on the log patterns, it appears that:

1. **Reload state management bug**: The pending reload state is never cleared
2. **Timer mechanism failure**: The "fallback timer" referenced in logs doesn't execute
3. **Race condition**: Multiple reload attempts might interfere with each other
4. **Resource locking**: Some internal resource might remain locked after failed reload

## Workarounds

### Temporary Solutions
1. **Service restart**: `sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.keypath.kanata`
2. **Process restart**: Kill and restart Kanata process
3. **Remove --watch flag**: Manually restart after each config change

### None are ideal for development workflow

## Expected Fix

The reload mechanism should:
1. **Complete successfully** when triggered
2. **Clear pending state** after completion/failure
3. **Provide meaningful error logs** if reload fails
4. **Implement proper timeout handling** for stuck reloads
5. **Allow subsequent reload attempts** even if previous ones failed

## Test Case

To verify the fix:
1. Start Kanata with `--watch`
2. Make multiple rapid configuration changes
3. Verify each change is applied correctly
4. Check logs show successful reload completion
5. Test that mappings work as expected after each change

## Additional Context

This bug was discovered during UI automation testing of a macOS keyboard remapping application that relies on Kanata's hot reload functionality. The issue completely breaks the development workflow for configuration iteration.

**Impact on downstream applications**: Any application using Kanata with `--watch` for dynamic configuration updates will be affected by this bug.
