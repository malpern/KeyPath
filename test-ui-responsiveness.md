# UI Responsiveness Test Plan

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Close Button Responsiveness**
- **Test**: Click the "✕" close button during operations
- **Expected**: Button should remain clickable and cancel operations
- **Previous Issue**: Button was disabled/unresponsive during operations

### 2. **Page Navigation During Operations**
- **Test**: Try to navigate between wizard pages while operations run
- **Expected**: Navigation should be prevented gracefully (no blocking)
- **Previous Issue**: Page dots became unresponsive

### 3. **Manual Refresh During Auto-Fix**
- **Test**: Click "Check Again" button while auto-fix is running
- **Expected**: Button should be disabled but UI remains responsive
- **Previous Issue**: Entire UI froze

### 4. **Operation Cancellation**
- **Test**: Start a long operation, then click "Cancel" in progress overlay
- **Expected**: Operation stops and UI returns to normal
- **New Feature**: Cancel button in progress overlay

### 5. **Keyboard Navigation**
- **Test**: Use left/right arrow keys during operations
- **Expected**: Keyboard shortcuts should be prevented during operations but UI stays responsive
- **Previous Issue**: Keyboard input was completely blocked

## Architecture Changes Made

### 1. **Task.detached Pattern**
- Operations now run in truly background threads
- UI thread is never blocked by operation execution
- Progress updates happen asynchronously via MainActor

### 2. **Cancellation Infrastructure**
- All operations can be cancelled via `cancelAllOperations()`
- Tasks are tracked and can be individually cancelled
- Close button cancels all operations before dismissing

### 3. **Non-blocking State Updates**
- All async operation callbacks are marked `@MainActor`
- State updates happen on main thread without blocking
- Progress updates use Task{} for thread safety

### 4. **UI Interaction Controls**
- Navigation is prevented during operations (non-blocking check)
- Buttons show appropriate disabled states
- Cancel button is available for long operations

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Build and run the app
swift build
./build/KeyPath.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyPath

# Test scenarios:
# 1. Open Installation Wizard
# 2. Navigate to Conflicts page
# 3. Click "Resolve Conflicts" (long operation)
# 4. While operation runs, try:
#    - Clicking close button (should work)
#    - Navigating pages (should be prevented gracefully)
#    - Clicking Cancel in progress overlay (should work)
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **UI Never Freezes**: Mouse/keyboard input always works
✅ **Operations Run in Background**: Progress indicators work smoothly  
✅ **Cancellation Works**: Users can cancel operations and close wizard
✅ **Graceful Prevention**: Navigation during operations is prevented without blocking
✅ **No Computer-wide Freezing**: System remains responsive
