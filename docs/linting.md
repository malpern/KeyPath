# Linting

- SwiftLint is run in CI; reports should be generated by the pipeline, not stored in the repo.
- Remove local artifacts like `swiftlint-report.txt` or `lint_issues.json` after inspection. If you need a report locally, run:

```bash
swiftlint lint --reporter json > /tmp/lint_issues.json
swiftlint lint > /tmp/swiftlint-report.txt
```

- If CI needs artifacts, upload them as build artifacts instead of committing them.
