# Custom Rules Inline Editor - Feature Gaps To Revisit

The Custom Rules UI now uses a lightweight inline editor for fast key-to-key mappings.
This removes the prior full-screen/modal editor and trades depth for speed.

Consider migrating or re-adding the following capabilities in the overlay drawer
so they remain available to power users:

- Editing existing rules directly from the Custom Rules list (not just delete/recreate).
- Advanced behaviors from the old editor (hold behavior variants, tap-dance steps, timing controls).
- Multi-step outputs for advanced slots (and any macro-specific text expansion if we keep it).

If these are added to the drawer later, document the new path from Settings to that editor.
